## Description
1. A browser based music production app which provides a set of individual instrumental sounds (ex. Bass kick, snare, high hat, guitar chords, piano chords, etc.) and a measure where the sounds can be placed freely by the user in order to cohesively produce music.
2. The user can register an account on the app which enables the user to save the music they produced, as well as store beats they upload to use. It also enables them to collaborate with others.
3. The app also provides a platform for users to upload and download music produced by other users of the site. When downloaded, the user can see each sound as it appears in the measure.
4. The user may upload mp3 files of their own and use the file in their repertoire.
5. Users can collaborate with others to produce music together at the same time on different machines.

## Beta Features
1. We aim to have the base application (1) as well as a simple user account (2) complete.
2. We will also include a simple interactive tutorial for users.
   - This tutorial will be in the form of pop ups that guide the user by asking them to click specific buttons.

## Final Features
1.  Documentation for frontend, backend, database
2.  Features 2, 3, 4 and a completed version of 5.
3.  Time permitting: A guitar or piano type interface to produce sequences
